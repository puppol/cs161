COMPILING AND RUNNING THE PROGRAM
- The program is titled hw6.cpp. Compile with g++, and it does not matter if you use
  -o or not. 
- run your executable with the size of board you wish play on
  ./a.out 8          ./a.out 10         ./a.out 12
- If you provide incorrect, you will have to re-run the ./a.out 8 command


WHEN PLAYING
- Player 1 is o, player 2 is x. The capital version of each is the King. o -> O
- Provide input as follows -> 'A6 B5'   OR    'A6 C4 E2'    without the 's
